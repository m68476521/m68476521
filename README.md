### Hi there 👋

🌱 My name is Miguel, I am a **Software Engineer**(especializing on **Android Development**) pursuing my Bachelors on **Computer Science & Engineering.**

🔭 I am really passionate and enusiatic about technologies. I have been coding small, medium and big projects. I am always on the mood of learning something. That brings me happyness.

:guitar: Outside of the world of technologies. I like to play guitar, videos games, basketball and soccer. 

⚡ I like reading books, especially about mistery one of my favorites ones is the novel *The long walk* by Stephen King. 

:beach_umbrella: I love traveling and go to somewhere new. My last trip was to Denmark to the KotlinConf 2019.  

:pencil2: I enjoy to be part of the Hacktoberfest
