### Hi there 👋

🌱 My name is Miguel, I am a **Software Engineer** specializing on **Android Development** and I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

🔭 I am really passionate and enthusiastic about technology. I have been coding small, medium and big projects. I am always in the mood of learning something. That brings me happiness.

:guitar: Outside of the world of technologies. I like to play guitar, video games, basketball and soccer. 

⚡ I like reading books, especially about mystery. One of my favorites is the novel *The Long Walk* by Stephen King. 

:beach_umbrella: I love traveling and going somewhere new.

:pencil2: I enjoy to be part of the Hacktoberfest
